   * Identified key trends and anomalies

3. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handled missing and inconsistent values
   * Ensured correct data types for analysis

4. **SQL Analysis**

   * Loaded cleaned data into a relational database
   * Wrote SQL queries to answer business questions such as:

     * Customer spending behavior
     * Discount effectiveness
     * Subscription impact on revenue
     * Product and category performance
     * Customer segmentation

5. **Dashboard Creation**

   * Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key insights

6. **Reporting & Presentation**

   * Created a structured project report
   * Designed a presentation using Gamma to summarize findings

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI dashboard includes:

* Revenue analysis by age group
* Comparison of subscribed vs non-subscribed customers
* Top products and categories
* Discount usage trends
* Customer segmentation insights

The dashboard enables quick understanding of patterns and supports data-driven decision-making.

## 🔍 Key Results & Insights

* Subscribed customers contribute higher average spend and total revenue
* Certain age groups generate the majority of revenue
* Discounts do not always reduce revenue and can attract high-value customers
* Loyal and repeat customers play a major role in overall sales
* A small number of products drive a large portion of purchases
